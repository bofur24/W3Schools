               <p><strong>Arial</strong> is considered the safest sans-serif font on the web. It is installed on all Windows machines (99.8%) and all Mac machines (98.7%).</p>

               <p><strong>Geneva</strong> is Verdanas preferred fallback, because the two fonts are quite similar, and Geneva runs on all Mac machines (99.6%).</p>
               <p><strong>Tahoma</strong> was the standard font in Windows 95. It works on (99.9%) of all Windows machines, and (91.7%) of all Mac machines.</p>
               <p><strong>Trebuchet MS</strong> has been released with all Windows operating systems (99.7%) since Microsoft Windows 2000. It is also included on Macs machines (97.1%), iOS and Chrome OS.</p>

                <p><strong>Courier New</strong> is considered the most web safe monospace font. It is installed on most Windows and Mac machines.</p>
                <p><strong>Lucida Console</strong> does not run on Mac. <strong>Monaco</strong> does not run on Windows.</p>
                <p>One solution is to use Monaco as fallback for Lucida Console.</p>
                <p>There are no 100% web safe fotns, but you can always use w3-monospace.</p>
